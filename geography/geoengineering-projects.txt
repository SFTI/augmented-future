Rewilding
A long-term process of rebuilding wilderness areas using advanced technology and genetic modified plant and animal life to deal with longer growing cycles, increased solar radiation, and less water.

Iron Fertilization
Seeding the oceans with iron to help remove CO2 from the atmosphere and increase the oxygen in the ocean have led to dangerous algae blooms (red tide) in some regions and a rapid, dangerous growth of jellyfish.  Despite these side effects many corporations have set up FE-fertilization projects.

Artificial Trees and Scrubbing Towers
Often used in conjunction with rewilding projects.
