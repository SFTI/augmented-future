AUGMENTED FUTURES GEOGRAPHY

The Physical World

Earth 
	Altered in the near future by global warming, large scale frakking, and attempts at geoengineering. The oceans no longer teem with life. Deserts have expanded from years of drought and winds. Coastlines have shrunk with rising sea levels. Rainforests have also been nearly wiped out except for a few strategic areas.
	
Near Earth
	The globe is encircled by a network of orbital communities. Mainly corporate research facilities housing scientists, special executives, and their families though a few are vacation communities.
	
Lunar Colony
	Earth's first attempt to relocate the burgeoning population off-planet, the lunar colony is actually three different colonies, Chinese-Vietnamese cooperative venture, a religious separatist group, and a politically fragile European collective. Together they've created a stable but fractious existence on the Moon but are barely self-sufficient.
	
Asteroid Belt
	A few asteroids have been targeted for mining operations. The initial attempts have just started.
